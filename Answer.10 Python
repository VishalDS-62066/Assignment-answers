# Test Case 1:
# In this test case, the text contains multiple instances of each part of speech.
# The program should count the occurrences of verbs, nouns, pronouns, and adjectives correctly.

# Test Case 2:
# In this test case, the text contains only adjectives.
# The program should correctly count the number of adjectives and return 0 for other part-of-speech categories.
